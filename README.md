# Python Face Recognition

Welcome to Python Face Recognition! This project utilizes computer vision techniques to detect and recognize faces in images or videos using Python and popular libraries such as OpenCV and dlib.

## Description

Python Face Recognition is a versatile tool that can be used for various applications, including:

- Face detection: Identify and locate faces within an image or video frame.
- Face recognition: Recognize known faces and label them accordingly.
- Emotion recognition: Detect facial expressions and emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, etc.
- Gender and age estimation: Estimate the gender and approximate age of detected faces.
- Facial landmark detection: Locate key facial landmarks such as eyes, nose, mouth, etc.

## Features

- Easy-to-use Python interface with comprehensive documentation.
- Support for both image and video input sources.
- Customizable parameters for face detection and recognition.
- Real-time face tracking and analysis.
- Integration with other Python libraries for further analysis or application development.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system (Python 3.x is recommended).

2. Install the required dependencies using pip:

    ```
    pip install opencv-python opencv-python-headless dlib numpy
    ```

3. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the files directly.

4. Navigate to the directory where the project is located.

5. Run the main Python script to start using the face recognition system:

    ```
    python face_recognition.py
    ```

## Usage

1. Open the main Python script (`face_recognition.py`) in your preferred editor.

2. Customize the script as needed, specifying input sources (image or video file), parameters for face detection and recognition, etc.

3. Run the script to start the face recognition system. Follow the on-screen instructions or check the console output for results.

4. Experiment with different settings and configurations to achieve the desired results.
